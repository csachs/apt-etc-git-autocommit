# apt-etc-git-autocommit

The `/etc` directory often drifts considerably over time, sometimes making it unclear when and why certain changes appeared later on. This two-line apt hook just stores everything into a git repository in `/etc` (`/etc/.git`) automatically. Beware, this includes sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`â€¦ permissions are set to `600` for the `.git` repository to prevent other users from accessing it, but I have not deeply investigated the security of this approach. Use at your own risk and with special care, particularly in multi-user systems.
